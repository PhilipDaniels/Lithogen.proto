This is the default Lithogen Plugins Folder.

To implement a Lithogen Plugin, create a type that implements one or more
or the interfaces from Lithogen.Core and drop the assembly in here.

It will be automatically loaded whenever Lithogen runs, and your types will
be used in preference to the Lithogen default types.
